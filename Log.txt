DONE: Implemented zoom limitations for mouse and keyboard zooming.

17:45 16.10.2002

10:31 18.10.2002
DONE: Unlimited number of graphs accepted.

16:37 25.10.2002
FIX: Corrected the zooming routines. If a scale factor exceeds range - it is set to the range value.
DONE: frmDocument.KeyPress and frmDocument.KeyDown use for temporary calculations the global lngTemp variable, as the frmDocuemnt.MouseMove handler.
DONE: Simplified several subroutines, which stored internally the frmDocument.ScaleWidth and frmDocument.ScaleHeight properties: now using the global llngSW and llngSH members.

17:00 25.10.2002
DONE: Moved the frmDocument.GraphsDraw code into the frmDocument.WindowRefresh sub, because not called from anywhere else.

17:08 25.10.2002
DONE: Removed unnecessary code regarding the restoration of defaults for frmDocument.DrawStyle and frmDocument.DrawWidth at the end of procedure which changes them. Now every sub is responsible for setting it's drawing attributes.

19:18 25.10.2002
FIX: frmTrace on load sets the frmMain.Activeform.DrawWidth property to 1 (in case it was modified by other subs).
DONE: Removed the cmdClose command button from the frmTrace form. Now catching the KeyPress event and checking for Escape key to close the window (frmTrace.KeyPreview = True).

20:45 29.04.2003
FIX: In frmEval the cmdEval handler tried to hook to the active document's variables collection even if no document was open.
