
-  Accept constant expressions in parameters text boxes
-  Make a menu command for direct graph adding
-  Prevent windows going off-screen (when loading saved positions)
-  Improve the interface (toolbar, status bar, dockable windows)
-  Make it understand the dragged-n-dropped links to documents

+  Possibility to customize Values font
+  Support an unlimited number of graphs
+  Implement factorial in evaluation engine
+  Update the documentation with keyboard shortcuts
+  Change the file format to an extensible one (implemented XML-like file format)
+  Use different draw widths. Draw same graph with lines and points
+  Place coordinates system origin proportionally when the window is resized.
+  Correct the problem with line crossing the borders of the view
+  Add during installation the samples to the recent files (made a link to the Samples folder in program group)
+  Make the Open/Save dialog default to the last used folders
+  Make Analyze work for custom Min, Max and Precision
+  Get rid of vb code common controls which rise a lot of problems.



Bugs:
+  Max length for Function in frmGraphProperties cboFunction is 255.

+  In frmEval, the cmdEval_Click handler tries to hook the active document variables collection even if no document present.

+  When loading, if the maximum number of graphs is exceeded, the following Graph tags are ignored, but the included tags are applied to the last added graph.

+  Change the color serialization mode to RGB (curently saves as BGR) to comply with the XML standard.

+  When a loaded expression causes validation to fail and to display a message box, the document window's Activate event is not invoked and the graphs list, commands and the variables list are not updated.

+  When in a large zoom and far from origin, values are displayed erroneously.
   (fixed - did not correctly clip the visible part)

+  The program crashes when a function loaded from the file is erroneous and is used somewhere.
   (fixed in 2.50.114 - on load erroneous functions are excluded)

+  Expressions such as e(x), pi(x), 1(x) are validated. Must check if node has a constant, then it must be a terminal node.
   (fixed in 2.50.102)

+  While analyzing, must take in account the graph's Max gap parameter. For example for the tan(x)/sin(x) function returns x=1.5708 as a zero.
   (fixed in 2.50.102)



User's suggestions:

-  Implement styles for the graph itself
-  Use something like "y=" or "f(x)=" when specifying a function.
-  Draw x(y) graphs
-  Draw f(x,y) - 3d graphs
-  Labels

We would like to show the area under the graph that is being
calculated as the integral.  So I specify a function, its
range and an interval, I see a plot of the 
Function with the area shaded and the value of the area as
the integral.  This should not be hard in two dimensions.
We can then think about volume etc. in higher dimensions.
The point is to "show" what is being calculated.  Another
problem is to shade the region under a function defined by
several constraints.  This would also be very helpful.

Best,

SC

Hello
I Have been using this software for a couple of days.
It is the best freeware graph software available.
There were some functions that need to be added.
1) presently the Equation needed has to be independent of y.
 i.e. the form is f(x)=y
We should be able to give an equation containing y
eg.   x^2+y^2=36[this is the equation of a circle centered at the origin.]
2)The function [x] should be introduced. [x] is the greatest integer smaller then x
  e.g. [156.36]=156
3)we should be able to use the hexadecimal system (Where sin 30= .5) for angles. i.e. tan(x) when x=45 should be equal to 1.
One should be able to change between radians & degrees.
4)The operation plus minus should be introduced.
this would be useful for taking out both positive & negative roots of quadratic equations
e.g. plus minus(25)^.5=5 or -5
Thanking you
Devdatta Tengshe
